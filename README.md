# Personal website
## Development
The aim was to create a simple personal website using a pre-created template (more information below). A blog app is still under construction and should be rolled out soon.
The deployment was done on Heroku.

The repository is not ready to be used straight out of the box. However, it should be quite easy to adapt it if you are willing to reuse it.
Do not hesitate to reach out if you have questions / have issues when trying to use this.

## Credits
